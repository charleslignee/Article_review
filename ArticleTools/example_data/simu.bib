abstract = {Herein a numerical study was conducted on a PCM coupling room integrated with a PCM active–passive coupling system to optimize it annual thermal characteristics. In detail, four kinds of inorganic composite PCMs were simultaneously introduced into the wall, ventilation cavity and double-layer radiant floor to construct a PCM active–passive coupling system. The numerical model constructed by EnergyPlus was validated based on the experimental result. The simulation results shown that, compared with the room with common radiant floor, the PCM coupling room exhibited a lower annual energy consumption and a higher indoor thermal comfort rate, which was increased by 16.58{\%}. Based on the thermal comfort evaluated by PMV-PPD method and annual energy consumption, a parameter optimization of the double-layer PCM radiant floor was performed, including the PCM thickness, the thermal conductivity and the location of the heat source. It was found that appropriately increasing the total thickness of the PCM layer could effectively enhance its heat storage capacity to improve the indoor temperature control effect. Specially, the total thickness and the thickness of the upper and lower PCM layers had optimal values. Furthermore, when the thermal conductivity of the upper PCM layer was fixed, increasing that of the lower PCM layer could improve the heat storage /release efficiency of the floor, while its enhancement effect gradually decreased. In addition, moving up or down the heat source would reduce the utilization rate of the PCMs. The radiant floor exhibited the optimal overall thermal performance when the heat source was placed between the two PCM layers. Finally, after parameter optimization, the PCM coupling room performed an indoor thermal comfort rate as high as 81.58{\%}, while saving 20{\%} of the electricity cost by utilizing the price difference between peak and valley electricity.},

abstract = {In recent years, applying phase change materials (PCMs) has attracted growing attention due to its potential to energy conservation with thermal comfort in the buildings. The proper use of PCM in a building can reduce the energy demand considerably, keeping the indoor temperature within the comfort range. One of the major issues associated with the use of PCM is the dependency of its performance on the climate conditions, such as the ambient temperature in which it is used. This study introduces an innovative double layer PCM system aim to improve thermal comfort conditions and minimize energy demand. In the scope of PCM performance improvement under different climates during hot and cold months, a constructive solution is the incorporation of two PCM types with different properties, such as melting temperature and enthalpy in room envelopes. The behavior of such a system under five different climatic regions with emphasis on dry and semi-arid climates as dominant climates of Iran was numerically investigated. The study of this new system is conducted by a room with one exterior and some interior boundary conditions in hot and cold months. In this work, The Fanger comfort model has been used for a comprehensive evaluation of new system's impact on thermal comfort conditions. The results showed that the double layer PCM system improves percentage of time in which the indoor thermal comfort conditions are met from 73{\%} to 93{\%} in dry climate, and from 63{\%} to 75{\%} in semi-arid climate in winter. Furthermore, the heating energy consumption is reduced by 17.5{\%} in dry climate, and by 10.4{\%} in semi-arid climate in the country of Iran.},

abstract = {Light-weight materials are comprehensively used to reduce the building weight in high-rise or super high-rise buildings, but they will reduce building thermal inertia remarkably, which can increase the air-conditioning load fluctuation and reduce indoor thermal comfortable. According to this condition, phase-change material (PCM) is filled to hollow bricks to improve thermal behavior by latent thermal storage. A numerical model with the heat transfer process of melting-solidifying was built, and a full-scale experiment was done to verify this model. Due to the filled PCM, the thermal performance of hollow bricks was improved obviously from experimental and numerical results. Under suitable phase-change temperature, the filled PCM can reduce the attenuation rate from 13.07{\%} to 0.92{\%}–1.93{\%} and increase the delay time from 3.83 h to 8.83h–9.83 h. Meanwhile, the filled PCM can reduce the peak heat flux from 45.26 W/m2 to 19.19 W/m2-21.4 W/m2, but cannot reduce the average value. In addition, inner cavities were the better choice for PCM and there was an extra phase-change extent of close to 90{\%} in favor of the different outdoor thermal environment. Finally, influence rules of latent heat and thermal conductivity coefficient of PCM were analyzed on temperature and heat flux in inner surfaces.},

The quantification of the impact of the PCM on the thermal comfort was accomplished using the concepts of maximum operative temperature reduction and discomfort index. A novel indicator of Total Discomfort Change (TDC) was introduced to select the optimum PCM. Thereafter, the behaviour of the optimised PCM was comprehensively evaluated through activation of PCM and PCM storage efficiency. In all cities, PCM 26 + NV showed the best performance achieving the TDC values of up to 1818 and its storage efficiency values were up to 39.1{\%}. Then, the analysis of the effect of real PCMs on the thermal comfort conditions was provided. The investigation revealed that RT 26 + NV was the most efficient in all cities achieving the TDC values of up to 1977. Thereafter, the impact of climate change under RCP 8.5 emission scenario (2095) was assessed and RT 28 + NV and RT 26 + NV were found to be optimum combinations. Overall, the optimum configuration of PCM with natural ventilation can be used for improving the thermal comfort conditions during the summertime in all cities of Kazakhstan.},

Two types of simulations have been carried out: the energy rate control test and the temperature level control test. The energy savings achieved by the addition of the PCM layer on the envelope of the test cubicle compared to the base case (no insulation) ranged between 21.7 and 28.6{\%}. The optimum PCM case was also combined with a common thermal insulation topology in Cyprus. The results showed that the maximum energy savings per year was achieved by the combined case (66.2{\%}). In the temperature level control test the constructions containing PCM performed better during summer. The results of the optimum PCM case and the combined case were economically evaluated using Life Cycle Cost (LCC). The results of this analysis showed that the PCM case has a very long payback period (14 ½ years) while this is changing when it is combined with insulation where the payback period is reduced to 7 ½ years.},

abstract = {Net zero energy buildings (nZEB) require the development of innovative technologies such as the use of phase change materials (PCMs) in walls for the energy requalification of low inertia buildings. The presence of a PCM layer in the external building wall, due to the effect of storage and release of latent energy phenomena, modifies the energy behavior, both during the summer and winter periods. This paper addresses the problem of the definition of the energetic behavior of a layer subject to phase change with periodic non-sinusoidal boundary conditions, characterizing the external walls of air-conditioned buildings. In such conditions, the layer is the site of the formation of one or more bi-phase interfaces, which originate on the boundary surfaces, or are always present and fluctuate within the layer. It is also possible that the layer does not undergo any phase change. The study has been developed by a finite difference numeric calculation model which explicitly determines the number and the position of the bi-phase interfaces that originate in the layer and the temperature and the heat flux fields. The surface heat fluxes are used to evaluate the PCM layer energetic behavior in terms of energy transferred through the boundary surfaces and of stored energy in sensible and latent form. The proposed method employs the characteristic day that it is periodically repeated for all the days of the considered month. The use of the characteristic days drastically reduces the computational burden of the numerical calculation and it allows to obtain guidance on the behaviour of the PCM throughout the year, in accordance with the variability of external climatic conditions, in order to select the PCM with the most suitable thermophysical properties. The methodology developed is applied to PCM layers with different melting temperatures and subject to climatic conditions of two locations, one with a continental climate and the second one with a Mediterranean climate. The results obtained allowed us to identify which PCM is more suitable in improving the energetic performances of building walls in the heating or cooling period during the year. In particular, the energy analysis highlighted that, in both localities, during the winter period: the lowest energy exiting from the indoor environment is ensured by a PCM with a melting temperature of 15 • C; the highest contribution of energy entering the indoor environment, mainly due to solar radiation, is recorded for a PCM with a melting temperature of 26 • C. During the summer period: the lowest value of energy entering the indoor environment is obtained by a PCM with melting temperature of 26 • C; the highest value of energy exiting from the indoor environment is ensured by a melting temperature equal to 20 • C. In both locations, a PCM with a melting temperature intermediate between those of the winter and summer set points of the indoor environment is the best compromise between winter and summer energy needs for an air-conditioned environment, as it allows obtainment of the highest values of the yearly total stored energy.},

The validation of the calculation model with experimental data was accomplished, and a good agreement of the temperature field between simulations and experimental data can be found. Then effect of thickness and melting temperature of PCM on thermal performance of double glazing units was investigated and the relevant parameters were analyzed. The results show that the interior surface temperature increases by 158.7{\%}, the total transmitted energy decreases by 109.1{\%} and the transmitted solar energy decreases by 86.1{\%} when PCM thickness is 50 mm, compared with its thickness 4 mm. With the increasing of PCM melting temperature, its utilization decreases. When the thickness increases from 4 mm to 30 mm, the liquid fraction increases, but the condition is reverse when it continues to increase to 50 mm.

abstract = {The use of night cooling ventilation in addition of phase change materials (PCMs) is a very powerful strategy for reducing the cooling demand of buildings. Nevertheless, there are inherent drawbacks in the way things have been doing so far: (a) The limited area of contact between PCM and the air; (b) the very low convective heat transfer coefficients which prevents the use of significant amounts of PCM and (c) the very low utilization factor of the cool stored due to the large phase shift between the time when cool is stored and time when it is required by the building. In this paper, we present innovative solutions using PCM to overcome the above situation. Compared with existing solutions, innovative solutions proposed, increase the contact area between PCM and air by a factor of approximately 3.6, increase the convective heat transfer coefficient significantly, and improve the utilization factor due to the inclusion of active control systems which allow the cold stored be actually used when required. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Integration of the phase change materials (PCM) into the external building walls is an efficient method for reduction of energy consumption and regulation of energy demands due to increasing thermal inertia of the walls. This study aims to reveal the contribution of latent heat to the thermal performance of the wall and to determine the location, thickness and melting temperature of PCM for the maximum exploitation of latent heat for different climatic conditions. A comparative study is carried out for the wall coupled with PCM and the wall with Phase Stabilized PCM (PSM) to reveal the improvement provided by the latent heat. The influence of location, fusion temperature and layer thickness of PCM on energy saving, decrement factor and time lag was examined. The annually optimized PCM fusion temperature and layer thickness which utilizes the latent heat at maximum level considering both heating and cooling loads are determined for three cities of Turkey. The computed results show that the monthly optimized PCM melting temperature and PCM layer thickness vary from 6 to 34 °C, from 1 to 20 mm depending on climatic conditions. It was concluded that an optimization study should be conducted in order to prevent PCM behaves like PSM.},

The indoor air temperature of single space houses and the effect of PCM ceiling panels were predicted by using the explicit form of numerical method and specific heat capacity method respectively. A comparison study on a single space house which was applied with ordinary ceiling panels and PCM ceiling panels has been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of passive cooling design in reducing air temperature of the house in both instances.

abstract = {This paper deals with the dynamic modeling of a typical single-zone building. It describes the development of a dynamic model for thermal transient analysis and its application to a simplified test case considering solar irradiation and internal radiation. The dynamic behavior of the indoor air temperature has been investigated by means of a lumped approach using a state-space representation developed in MATLAB/Simulink. A set of daily temperature profiles, which are representative of the Mediterranean climatic condition, on a few different winter days, has been used as boundary conditions for the dynamic simulations. In addition, the model has been validated using two different sets of experimental data available in the literature, both statically and dynamically. Finally, a layer of insulation with a phase change material (PCM) is applied to the single zone building to quantify its effect on the building's behavior. The results showed that the rate and amount of energy consumption in the building with PCM are moderately lower than the building without PCM. In addition, the variation of inlet air temperature, solar effects, and energy consumption have been evaluated for a case study example, as well as comfort in transient simulation to achieve a complete evaluation of the test building investigated. A satisfactory agreement was obtained between the experimental and the simulation results and shows that the model can be used for a wide range of materials, dimensions, thermal resistances, and boundary conditions.},

Latent heat of fusion was used to reduce the heat loads fluctuation and peak time shifting. That, in turn, reduces the consumed energy for cooling and therefore reduces the green gas emissions. A one day versus a seven days analysis was performed and compared to account for the cyclic behavior of the PCM in the building material. The study focuses on demonstrating the deceiving results which can be concluded from each analysis. The results demonstrate that choosing the proper PCM material for this application is tricky and required at least a seven day analysis evaluation. A One day evaluation can be misleading, where its results suggest that using the n-Octadecane PCM with a melting temperature of 27 °C provides the best energy saving for this application. Meanwhile, based on a seven day analysis the PCM P116 with a melting temperature of 47 °C demonstrated the best performance.},

Its high thermal storage capacity during phase change - up to 300Wh/(m2day) - enables the overall panel thickness to be limited to a mere 5cm. Active control of the thermal storage is achieved by means of an integrated water capillary tube system.

The considered model consists of a concrete slab with vertical cone frustum holes filled with PCM. The objective of incorporating the PCM into the roof structure is to utilize its high latent heat of fusion to reduce the heat gain during the energy demanded peak hours, by absorbing the incoming energy through the melting process in the roof before it reaches the indoor space. The thermal effectiveness of the proposed roof-PCM system is determined by comparing the heat flux at the indoor surface to a roof without the PCM during typical working hours. A parametric study is conducted to assess the effects of the cone frustum geometry, and the kind of PCM used. The n-Eicosane shows the best performance among the examined PCMs, and the conical geometry of the PCM container is the best in term of thermal effectiveness. The results indicate that the heat flux at the indoor surface of the roof can be reduced up to 39{\%} for a certain type of PCM and geometry of PCM cone frustum holes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

Under such conditions, residential and tertiary buildings, which have lightweight walls, may be vulnerable to internal overheating. Heat waves penetrating the building lead to occupant's discomfort and dissatisfaction. Creating an internal climate, which is independent or slightly dependent on external conditions, can be an appropriate solution to mitigate temperature fluctuations. The adoption of new approaches to improve the thermal inertia of lightweight walls is currently among the most widely accepted techniques in literature. In this study, the integration of phase change material (PCM) in building hollow bricks (widely used in Morocco construction) is proposed to improve the thermal performance of external walls. High latent heat of fusion of PCMs will help to dampen the heat flow through the envelope. Physical modeling and numerical analysis of heat transfer through the hollow bricks containing PCM has been carried out. A parametric study was conducted to evaluate the effect of weather conditions on the thermal response of this building element, also the influence of PCM properties are studied and discussed.

In climates with high thermal variability, thermal mass can increase the hours of thermal comfort and reduce the need for mechanical conditioning systems, helping to reduce the energy consumption in both new and existing buildings. However, it is not always feasible to use traditional materials to increase thermal energy storage in building retrofitting. The use of Phase Change Materials (PCM) can be an alternative to provide high thermal storage capacity to rehabilitated buildings as their applications have relatively low weight and need little or no additional space. Different ways in which PCM can be used in building rehabilitation have been analyzed, and the influence of PCM drywall panels and fenestration was evaluated in different Spanish cities. The results reflect the importance of the Window to Wall ratio and the Shading Factor in the thermal behavior of buildings. Also, they show that, with proper selection of these parameters, the use of PCM drywall can contribute to increase the thermal comfort, reducing the peaks and temperature fluctuations in existing buildings, particularly under overheating conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {The energy retrofitting of existing buildings is of major importance to reach the energy sustainability target set by the European Union (EU) for 2020. Innovative retrofitting solutions can involve the adoption of Phase Change Materials (PCMs), but an effective use of PCM in buildings requires an appropriate selection of the thermo-physical properties, quantity and position of the PCMs. To guarantee a good functioning of a PCM and ensure economic feasibility, an optimisation of PCM use is advisable. In the present paper, multi-objective optimisation analyses for the energy retrofitting of office buildings with PCM-enhanced opaque building envelope components are presented. A retrofitting intervention on either the external or internal side of the opaque envelope was considered, and a maximum of two PCM layers with different melting temperatures were selected and placed in different positions within the wall. Two sets of objective functions were minimised; first, primary energy consumption and global costs, and then the building energy needs for heating and cooling and investment costs. The search variables included the thickness and thermo-physical properties of the PCM layers, the window type, the insulation and internal lining materials, the wall configuration and U-value. In order to provide a robust methodology to drive designers towards an informed choice of the final retrofitting strategy, post-optimisation analyses were additionally carried out to investigate the variable values that led to the optimal solutions. Interesting and non-trivial information was obtained. The optimal thermo-physical properties of PCMs were found to be affected in particular by the operation of the HVAC system.},

Energy storage can potentially reduce electric demand. Among different technologies, phase change materials (PCMs) embedded in the building envelope have the potential to shift cooling energy demand away from peak hours. This study performs parametric analysis of PCMs in a relatively new home located in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. The analysis includes PCM location, PCM properties, precooling strategy, and an analysis of natural and forced convection models on the thermal behavior of the house. An extension of a standard forced convection model in EnergyPlus is used to represent the effects of a ceiling fan, which increases heat transfer at wall and ceiling surfaces and shortens the time needed to freeze or melt the phase change materials. Furthermore, the study discusses the use of appropriate setback temperatures to best utilize the PCMs. Overall, the optimal combination of PCMs, convection mode, and precooling schedule can completely shift cooling energy use during a three-hour demand period, producing maximum cost savings up to 29.4{\%}, while increasing the occupant comfort.},

abstract = {This research quantitatively investigates the thermal performance and energy efficiency of the residential building integrated with nine PCMs (PCM19 to PCM27) in different cities of subarctic climate (Dfc according to Koppen-Geiger climate classification). The thermal performance was evaluated by using the concept of average temperature fluctuation reduction (ATFR), maximum temperature reduction (MTR) and discomfort hours. ATFR allowed estimating the monthly PCM performance and determining the periods where it worked the best. MTR was used to quantitatively estimate the effect of PCM on maximum air temperature reduction during different seasons (swing and summer) while the concept of discomfort hours was used to investigate the effect of PCM on human thermal comfort. Thereafter, the concept of annual energy savings was used to evaluate the possibility of using a few PCMs for the whole Dfc climate zone. Finally, economic and environmental analyses were performed to evaluate the utility of PCMs in the subarctic climate. The results showed that the residential building integrated with PCM demonstrated better performance in terms of ATFR, especially during the warm season. Based on maximum temperature reduction results, PCMs with low melting temperatures were optimum during swing season, whereas PCMs with high melting temperatures were optimum in the summer period. According to the energy analysis results, the annual energy savings for the subarctic climate were up to 10000 kWh. It was confirmed that few optimum PCMs (PCM23 and PCM24) can be used for the whole subarctic climate to enhance the energy efficiency of the building. Finally, from the economic analysis, the payback period varied from 16 to 32 years while from environmental analysis, the annual CO2 savings up to 4817 kg were obtained. Conclusively, PCMs can significantly improve the thermal and energy performance of the buildings in the Dfc region.},

abstract = {The phase change material (PCM) applied in the roof can decrease the building energy consumption and improve the thermal comfort by enhancing the thermal energy storage capacity of building envelope. In the present work, the thermal performance of different kinds of roofs with and without PCM in Northeast and cold area of China, i.e. common roof and PCM roofs, have been investigated numerically. This study also explored the influencing factors of thermal behavior of the roofs, such as solar radiation intensity, transition temperature and latent heat of PCM, roof slope, PCM layer thickness, and absorption coefficients of external roof surface. The results show that the PCM roofs effect on the temperature delay in the room is very strong and the delay time of temperatures peak of base layer in PCM roofs are beyond 3 h than common roof. The effect of transition temperature and latent heat of PCM on the thermal performance of roofs is relatively weak, compared with the roof slope, PCM layer thickness and absorption coefficients of external roof surface.},

abstract = {Phase change materials (PCM) can be outfitted in building envelopes to not only provide thermal comfort for occupants but also trim heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) loads. However, the efficacy of PCMs depends highly on its thermo-physical properties and climatic condition. In this regard, a multi-objective optimization technique is adopted to unearth the optimal type and location of PCM that can minimize heating and cooling loads considering five cities of Iran namely Tehran, Tabriz, Bandar Abas, Shiraz and Yazd with distinctive climates. Then, the optimal PCMs are environmentally and economically assessed. The study showed that the PCM with a melting temperature of 25 °C outperforms in terms of cooling load while the PCM with a melting temperature of 21 °C favors the heating performance. Moreover, the utilization of PCM results in electricity saving of 4.5–5.5{\%} for all the climates. On average, the annual carbon footprint is reduced by 1297 kg, 1420 kg, 2040 kg, 1027 kg, and 1248 kg for Tehran, Tabriz, Bandar Abas, Shiraz, and Yazd, respectively. The payback period was found to be more than 70 years for all the cities considering current economic conditions. However, the energy subsidies are projected to fall in the near future that may make PCM integration economically feasible.},

abstract = {The urban heat island (UHI) phenomenon incurs various problems for human health as fine dust and hazardous pollutants are not ventilated well in urban areas. For example, downtown areas had a higher temperature than that of suburban regions. The purpose of the present study is to derive the reduction effect on the UHI phenomenon by applying phase-change material (PCM) to building roofs as a foundational study to reduce the UHI phenomenon. In the present study, an effect of reduction in surface temperature was verified through mock-up performance test on a PCM cool roof system manufactured by combining a PCM and radiation hardened wood (wood-plastic composite), and analysis on temperature distribution simulation was conducted by utilizing the mock-up test results to verify the temperature reduction in the canopy layer and roof surface. The study result showed that a temperature was decreased by 6.8 °C on average when the PCM cool roof system was applied. The result of the temperature distribution simulation based on the above experimental data verified that a temperature in the urban canopy layer in the commercial zone was reduced by 7.8 °C in summer and 11.3 °C in winter, and that in the residential zone was decreased by 6.4 °C in summer and 10.5 °C in winter, respectively.},
